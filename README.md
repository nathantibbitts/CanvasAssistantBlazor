This is a rebuild of a project used to help improve efficiency when grading assignments using Instructure's Canvas. The original, [Found Here](https://github.com/cdmccauley/canvasser),
was made using Next.js, while this rebuild uses Blazor. A running version of the old build can be found [here](https://canvasser.vercel.app/).
This project is currently a work in progress, and is not functioning.

## Getting Started
- Fork the repo: https://github.com/Davis-Technical-College/CanvasAssistantBlazor
- Clone the repo to your local machine from the fork.
- Check the Issues page on the original repo to see what may need work.

### Dependencies
Install [.NET SDK C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) extension on VS or Code Editor of choice.
- .NET SDK version 8.0 or higher, an earlier version will not run the program.
- C# extension on Visual Studio (preferred over VS Code) or another code editor of choice.

## Help
Ensure that you are running an updated Visual Studio or text editor, and an updated .NET SDK. Currently the program is using version 8.0. It wont run on an earlier version.

As of 2/28/2024 the only pages available are a 'Hello, world!' page with a counter that increments by 3, another counter page that increments by one, and a weather page using randomized placeholder data.

## Steps on running the program with Visual Studio
 1. When you open the folder, you will see many files. Open up "CanvasAssistantBlazor.sln" with Visual studio **2022** or **NEWER**.
 2. On the top of the screen. You will see **https** with a green arrow. Click on that to run the program (it may take a minute to run).
 3. Once the program opens up, it will ask to save certificates to you computer. You will require Admin privilege to install them. **This is normal!**
 4. The app will function without the certificates installed, but your connection will **not** be secure.
 5. Congrats, the app has opened!
